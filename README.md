 # Web Scraping and EDA project on Analysis on top rated movies from IMDB website
This project is regarding analysis on top rated movies using IMDB.com website.

 We did this project as a team of two members. First we have collected the data from IMDB.com website based on our requirements by right clicking particular data and inspected that and parsed the html code from it.
We totally selected 487 rows and 10 columns  scrape the data. After that we have cleaned the unwanted data by using mode and replace to fill the Null values. After cleaning the data we have collected totally 487 rows and 10 columns. We have exported the cleaned data into csv file for data analysis and further processing.
In data analysis we have used univarite, bivariate and multivariate analysis and explored the data in plots.
Finally we did the power point presentation on the above data analysis.
